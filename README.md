# DHRI Curriculum Workshops

This repository hosts a series of interactive workshops developed as part of the Digital Humanities Research Institute (DHRI) curriculum. These workshops are designed to teach digital humanities skills through an engaging learning environment featuring quizzes, interactive code snippets, and guided lessons.

## Workshop Format

Each workshop in this repository follows a structured format to facilitate learning. The workshops are designed for both self-paced learners and instructors and include the following key components:

### 1. Metadata
At the top of each workshop file, metadata provides essential details to guide instructors and learners. The metadata typically includes:
- **Title**: The name of the workshop.
- **Description**: A summary of the workshop content.
- **Learning Goals**: Skills and competencies participants will acquire by completing the workshop.
- **Prerequisites**: Knowledge or tools participants should have before starting the workshop.
- **Duration**: Estimated time required to complete the workshop.
- **programming_language**: A special key that tells DHRIFT which side bar tool to use. Possible choices:
  - 'jupyter': includes a WASM Jupyter Notebook instance
  - 'command_line': includes a simulated command line
  - 'javascript': includes a JavaScript code editor
  - 'python': includes a Python code editor
  - 'html': includes an editor similar to jsfiddle

### 2. Interactive Features
The workshops are built with **DHRIFT** (Digital Humanities Research Institute Framework for Teaching) in mind, which provides the following interactive elements:
- **Quizzes**: Each workshop includes quizzes to assess participants' understanding at key stages. These quizzes are placed throughout the lessons to reinforce learning.
- **Interactive Code Snippets**: Code examples are integrated directly into the content using platforms like Jupyter Notebooks or web-based code editors, allowing users to test and modify code in real time.
- **Hands-On Activities**: Many workshops include exercises that require learners to apply the concepts being taught through practical tasks.

### 3. Instructional Flow
Workshops are structured to gradually introduce concepts, with a balance of theory and practice. The typical instructional flow includes:
- **Introduction**: Overview of the topic and its importance in the digital humanities.
- **Core Concepts**: Detailed explanations of the skills or knowledge being taught, with demonstrations.
- **Interactive Exercises**: Participants practice the concepts through real-world examples or code snippets.
- **Quizzes**: Short assessments to ensure comprehension before moving forward.
- **Summary and Further Reading**: Recap of key points and links to additional resources.
